1. Define the following terms as they relate to networking:
	- A network
	- Protocols
	- Standards
	- Data Communication
	---
	- A network is a group or system of interconnected devices
	- Protocols are rules that determine how data is tranferred between devices in a network
	- Standards are protocols that have been adopted by manufacturers and vendors
	- Data communication is the transmission of data between two or more computers
	---
1. Write short notes on the following:
	- A switch
	- A hub
	- Throughput
	- Jitters
	- A router
	- Latency  
	---
	- A switch is a hardware that connects devices on a computer network and transmits data by creating temporary connections between the sender and the receiver
	- A hub is a networking device used to connect multiple Ethernet devices together
	- Throughput is the rate of succesful message delivery in a networking channel
	- Jitter is the time taken for a packet to reach the receiver from the sender
	- A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks
	- Latency is used to describe delays in communication over a network
	---
1.	- What is a network model  
	- Give two examples of network model
	- Relate the two named models with aid of diagram
	---
	- Network model is a design or architecture to accomplish communication between different systems
	-  examples:
		- TCP/IP
		- OSI
	- relationship between TCP/IP and OSI models  
		![tcp/ip and osi model similarities](./assets/tcp-ip-osi.png)

1. - Define the following terms
		- Bandwidth
		- Propagation time
		- Transmission time
	- Dave decided to send a vital document of 2.5-kbyte by email to his cousin in the East using the bandwidth of 1 Gbps. Given that the distance between Anchor University and the city where the cousin dwells is 12,000 km. Assuming light travels at a speed of 2.4 x 108 m/s, calculate the:
		- Propagation time
		- Transmission time
	--- 
	-
		- Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a given path
		- Propagation time is the time taken for a bit to propagate from one router to the next
		- Transmission time is the time required for the router to push out the packet
	-  CALCULATION->
		- Propagation time:
		- Transmission time:

1. - What is network topology
	- Discuss four types of network topologies you know
	---
	- Network topology refers to the physical or logical way a network is arranged
	- 
		- Star: In a star topology, each device has a dedicated point-to-point link only to a central controller, usually called a hub and  a star topology does not allow direct traffic between devices
		- Bus: A bus network is a network topology in which nodes are directly connected to a common half-duplex link called a bus
		- Mesh: Mesh topology is a type of networking where all nodes cooperate to distribute data amongst each other
		- Ring: A ring network is a network topology in which each node connects to exactly two other nodes, forming a single continuous pathway for signals through each node - a ring

1. Discuss 5 critical factors you will consider while planning your network

	---
	- Consider usage requirement 
	- Gather input
	- Plan for the future
	- Decide who will mange the network
	- Security issues
	---
1. AUL Technology Ltd is an ICT company with branches across the 36 states of Nigeria and the FCT. You are to be employed as the Chief Information Officer (CIO), how would you convince the Interview Panel that Switching should be better than the topologies being currently used?

	---
	- Switching can manage traffic either coming into or exiting the network by utilizing MAC address and can connect devices like computers and access points with ease increasing effeciency and security

1. A certain University is known for granting a restricted access to the network by allocating to each student a free-weekly-data of 2MB. Each student is identified in the Access Control List (ACL) after the format: first.lastname@university.edu. You are required, therefore and from network security point of view, to:
	- Identify and discuss associated issues regarding this convention.
	- Discuss possible ways of managing student users (access wise) on the network
	- create a simple algorithm to simply manage the student access
